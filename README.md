Thinking about reaching a wider audience when accessing an application, in addition to the Gama-Bank front end web project, we were able to experience the development of the mobile application.

Each part of the application was designed, tested and revised, to offer the end user an extremely satisfactory experience in accessing and using the resources offered by Gama-Bank.

The application's loyalty in relation to the client's visual identity was also thought of in its details, in order to make the client's communication with its target audience ever closer, limited by the credibility and trust attributed to this organization.

Technically the application was developed in order to contribute to any future needs for scalability of the application, so that it can accompany the growth of the brand with its consumer market.
